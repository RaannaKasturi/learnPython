# Virtual Environment in Python
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most Python developers use.

### (if required) Install venv
$ `pip install venv`

### Create Virtual Environment
- Create roject folder and open bash/cmd
- $ `python -m venv envName`

### Activate Virtual Environment
- Windows -> $ `source envName/scripts/activate`
- Linux/Mac -> $ `source envName/bin/activate`

### Deactivate Virtual Environment
$ `deactivate`
